# odin-etch-a-sketch

<p>A HTML CSS JavaScript project</p>
<p>A drawable area is the main feature of this work. Using JavaScript, I wrote a program to generate a user defined number of cells to form a grid. This grid can then be drawn upon. The program uses an array to store newly created cells and some math is used to access the cell size based on the overall size of the grid. Event listeners are used throughout to track mouse moevements when over the grid draw area.</p>

<strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Option to change number of cells</li>
  <li>Eraser</li>
  <li>Colour changer</li>
  <li>Ability to change cell shape</li>
  <li>Grid layer configurator</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I also pushed myself to create a closer interaction between CSS + JavaScript to create fluid animations.</p>

<p>I began this project on the 15th Feb 2022. After Some intial experimenting, I am now ready to begin building the project into the final version.</p>
